# TopCoder Open API

## Overview

The API uses the ActionHero framework. If you are not familiar with it, please [checkout their wiki](http://actionherojs.com/wiki) especially the sections for actions and initializers. You may also want to check out their [tutorial](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero-tutorial). There is also sample code in the /actions and /initializers directories above to get you started.

[The API documentation is available at our apiary project](http://docs.tcoapi.apiary.io/) and should be used as the basis for building this API. Please refer to it often. If you find something wrong with the API or need something added or modified, please use github issues. All code submitted for this project must have accompanying tests or it will not be accepted.

The data for the API resides in Salesforce and is sync'd to Postgres using [Heroku Connect](https://www.heroku.com/connect) (HC). When building the API you will only use Postgres but just be aware that data is being sync'd back and forth. You can [find more info on HC here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/herokuconnect).

When HC creates the tables in Postgres is uses the Salesforce style table and field names, except the database uses only lower-case letters. Therefore, the table that holds all of the Event data will be called `tco_event__c` and any custom fields that were added will also contain `__c`, example `start_time__c`. The Saleforce Id field is renamed as `sfid` in the database table.

For more info on connecting to PG from the command line, see [Accessing the synchronized tables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/herokuconnect#accessing-the-synchronized-tables). To connect in terminal use the connection string you were provided. **If you need this connection string, please email jeff@appirio.com and reference this repo.**

```
psql [CONNECTION-STRING]
set search_path=salesforce,public;
\d
```

For your application, add the connection string to your environment with:

```
export CLOUDCONNECT_CONN=[CONNECTION-STRING]
```

The API should **not** return fields to the client with `__c`. There are two ways to remove these:

1 - Use the [forcifier package](https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/forcifier-node) to remove the `__c` from the JSON before returning the results:

```javascript
var forcifier = require('forcifier');

var client = new pg.Client(api.config.general.pg.connString);
client.connect(function(err) {
  var sql = "select * from salesforce.tco__c";
  client.query(sql, function(err, rs) {
    if (err) next(err);
    if (!err) next(forcifier.deforceJson(rs['rows'])); // remove all __c's        
  })
})
```

2 - Alias the columns in the query. This may be the easiest route:

```javascript
var client = new pg.Client(api.config.general.pg.connString);
client.connect(function(err) {
  var sql = "select event.id, event.type__c as type, tco.unique_id__c as tco_id " +
   "from salesforce.tco_event__c as event " +
   "inner join salesforce.tco__c as tco on event.tco__c = tco.sfid";
  client.query(sql, function(err, rs) {
    if (err) next(err);
    if (!err) next(rs['rows']);         
  })
})
```


## Installation

You should be able to fork this repo, run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the app on port 8080.

## Development

### No callback hell! 

Always use Promises; [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) is already installed so please use it. [Here is some sample code](https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/nforce-tooling/blob/master/test/deploy.js) using Promises if you'd like to take a look.


### Running tests

For testing, always use [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and any assertion style that you like but try and stick to `Should` if you can. You must have 

You can run tests with `npm test`.

### SQL Injection

Make sure your code prevents SQL injection attacks. See these examples for [querying](https://github.com/cloudspokes/cs-api-node/blob/master/initializers/communities.js#L46) and [inserting records](https://github.com/cloudspokes/cs-api-node/blob/master/initializers/challenges.js#L184).

### Latest Code

Before you start on a new issue, always do `git pull` to get the latest changes into your local branch.

## Database Schema

Here are the PG tables with some sample data. A sample query to return all events would look like:

```sql
select 
  event.id, 
  event.name, 
  event.sfid,
  event.type__c as type,
  tco.unique_id__c as tco_id 
from salesforce.tco_event__c as event 
inner join salesforce.tco__c as tco on event.tco__c = tco.sfid;
```
